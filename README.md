# Elma Imager
<!-- markdown editor: https://dillinger.io/ -->
Tool for creating images from replays and levels, based on Maxdamantus' recplayer.

- Writes gifs, png sequences, and even sprite sheets. Transparent background or your chosen lgr (if you make transparent .png files from it).
- Makes the process of creating videos much easier than before.
- Single or multiple recs
- Also comes with the fully functional recplayer WITH images! Works without even installing NPM, locally. Just open index.html. However, this is not up to date with the project.

## Install
- Download elma-imager (download all files and folders as .zip and then unzip, or clone with git): https://github.com/RobinManoli/elma-imager

### Build
- Install NPM
```sh
cd elma-imager
npm install
pkg .
```
You can now run commands (slower) using:
```sh
npm run img -- -r elmapath/rec/myrec.rec -l elmapath/lev/mylev.lev -o myproject/path/myrec*.png
```


## Manual

### Getting Started
This is only tested on Windows for now. You can use backslashes in paths if you want.


### Create a sequence of .pngs
Make sure you create the folder ```myproject/path/``` first, because the files will be written there.
Note that you have to use the asterisk symbol * for this to work.
The asterisk will be replaced by each image's corresponding rec frame number.
```sh
cd elma-imager
elma-imager-win.exe -r elmapath/rec/myrec.rec -l elmapath/lev/mylev.lev -o myproject/path/myrec*.png
```

### Setting width, height, starting frame, ending frame
Below will start from frame 10 and process until frame 100, rendering 640x480 pixels.
```sh
elma-imager-win.exe -r elmapath/rec/myrec.rec -l elmapath/lev/mylev.lev -o myproject/path/myrec*.png -w 640 -h 480 -s 10 -e 100
```


### Using starting / ending time instead of frame number
Below will start from frame at 1.0 second (frame 30) and process until 2.5 seconds (frame 75).
```sh
elma-imager-win.exe -r elmapath/rec/myrec.rec -l elmapath/lev/mylev.lev -o myproject/path/myrec*.png -s 1.0 -e 2.5
```


### Create a .gif from a .rec
This might be slow, especially if you use ```-g transparent``` - so it's good to start out using small width, height and limited amount of frames. You don't have to use ```-s 0``` since starting from frame 0 is default.
If you're having trouble with transparency and black colors, you might need to create .pngs and make the .gif with another tool.
Below will create a .gif starting from frame 0 processing until frame 10, rendering 200x200 pixels.
```sh
elma-imager-win.exe -r rec/myrec.rec -l lev/mylev.lev -o path/myrec.gif -s 0 -e 10 -w 200 -h 200
```


### Rendering only the level
To render only the level, do not add any replay. You might want to fit the level to the image, using ```-Z```.
```sh
elma-imager-win.exe -l lev/mylev.lev -o path/mylevel.png -w 640 -h 480 -Z
```
You can also render a level as an animated .gif. To do that, you need a replay that is at least as long as your desired animation. Use the transparent_kuski lgr for kuski and shirt:
```sh
elma-imager-win.exe -r rec/myrec.rec -l lev/mylev.lev -o path/mylevel.gif -w 640 -h 480 -Z -e 2.5 -k transparent_kuski -S img\transparent_kuski\q1body.png
```

### Transparency
Normally the kuski, food, killers and flowers are visible. All other images inside ```elma-imager/img/transparent``` are just a transparent pixel.
- If you want to render any other image, copy it as a transparent .png from your desired lgr, but keep the same filename as in ```elma-imager/img/transparent```
- You can check ```elma-imager/img/default``` to see what images the filenames represent. The filenames are the same as in ```elma-imager/img/transparent```.
- If you don't want to render something, copy one of the transparent pixel images inside ```elma-imager/img/transparent``` and rename it to the thing you want to be transparent.
- Transparency is slow if you don't set the width and height, because it first renders with a large frame to find the edges. The output will not be cut exactly at the edges, but instead with the kuski in the center.

Below will start from frame 10 and process until frame 20, cropping near the edges.
```sh
elma-imager-win.exe -r elmapath/rec/myrec.rec -l elmapath/lev/mylev.lev -o myproject/path/myrec*.png -s 10 -e 20 -g transparent
```


### Multiple recs
When you render multiple replays, the regular ```-r myreplay.rec``` will be rendered normally, and will be in the center. You can then add other replays to be rendered, though they will not be centered.

Below will render all .rec files starting with ```29```, starting from frame 10 and process until frame 100, rendering 640x480 pixels.
To make sure you will render the correct recs, you can first check the output with ```dir elmapath/rec/29*.rec``` (Windows) or ```ls elmapath/rec/29*.rec```.
```sh
elma-imager-win.exe -r elmapath/rec/29main.rec -R elmapath/rec/29*.rec -l elmapath/lev/mylev.lev -o myproject/path/myrec*.png -w 640 -h 480 -s 10 -e 100
```


### Cli Options
These are the available command line options:
```
  -r, --rec <pattern>      path and filename for main replay to render, for example elmapath/rec/myrec.rec
  -l, --lev <name>         path and filename for level to render, for example elmapath/lev/mylev.lev
  -o, --output <pattern>   output filename or pattern, for example myproject/path/myreplay.gif, or myproject/path/ (default: "")
  -w, --width <number>     width of output frame (integer) (default: 0)
  -h, --height <number>    height of output frame (integer) (default: 0)
  -z, --zoom <number>      float, use smaller than 1 (for example 0.5) to zoom out, or larger than 1 (for example 10) to zoom in (default: 1)
  -g, --lgr <name>         default or transparent (default: "default")
  -s, --start <number>     starting frame (integer), or time in seconds (float, such as 1.0) (default: "0")
  -e, --end <number>       ending frame (integer), or time in seconds (float, such as 65.0) (default: "999999")
  -R, --replays <pattern>  path and filename for extra replays to render, for example elmapath/rec/29*.rec
  -d, --delay <number>     delay in milliseconds between displaying each frame in .gif (default: 33)
  -D, --debug              debug output
  --help                   display help for command
```


### Output Filename
If you want to keep track of the settings you've used you can save the commands in a textfile. But you can also automatically keep some information in the filenames.
You use the name of the option (which you can see listed in the command line options above), prefixed by the % character, to use it in the filename.
You can also use %frames to output the number of frames rendered.

Below will output the frame height and width in the filename:
```sh
elma-imager-win.exe -r elmapath/rec/myrec.rec -l elmapath/lev/mylev.lev -o myproject/path/myrec*_width%width_height%height.png -w 680 -h 480
```
Results in something like (* is replaced by frame number):
```sh
myrec001_width680_height480.png
myrec002_width680_height480.png
...
```
If you want more verbose filenames:
```sh
elma-imager-win.exe -r elmapath/rec/29Spef.rec -l elmapath/lev/QWQUU029.lev -o myproject/path/%rec_%lev_%framesframes_w%width_h%height_s%start_e%end_%lgr.gif -w 300 -h 300
```
Results in something like:
```sh
29Spef_QWQUU029_175frames_w300_h300_s0_e174_default.gif
```


### Custom LGR
There are some lgrs included, which you can try out. See the ```elma-imager/img``` folder. You have to set lgr, bike and shirt, unless you want the default lgr/bike/shirt to be rendered.
Below the default lgr is used, but with player2's bike and body, and Spef's shirt (if you have converted it to a transparent .png and saved in the correct path).
```sh
elma-imager-win.exe -r elmapath/rec/myrec.rec -l elmapath/lev/mylev.lev -o myproject/path/myrec*.png -g default -k default_kuski2 -S elmapath/png/spef.png
```
You can use any lgr you want, as long as you can get the graphics as transparent .png images. Make copy of ```elma-imager/img/default``` to ```elma-imager/img/mylgr``` and replace the images there - with the same filenames!
Then use the -g option:
```sh
elma-imager-win.exe -r elmapath/rec/myrec.rec -l elmapath/lev/mylev.lev -o myproject/path/myrec*.png -g mylgr
```
You can also create an lgr with only the kuski graphics, if you will be using another lgr for the other graphics. See the folder ```elma-imager/img/default_kuski2```


### Your Own Shirt or Another Bike
You can create a new lgr (see above) for each shirt or bike you want to use. Just replace the body, or any images you want, with the corresponding shirt or bodypart. Note that if you use multiple replays for the same output they will all use the same shirt.


### Create a Spritemap
If you don't use the asterisk symbol * in the -o output option the .png will be a sprite map instead of a sequence of images.
You shouldn't use the options -w --width, or -h --height here, so that the edges will be set automatically.
This can be slow, because it first renders with a large frame to find the edges. The output will not be cut exactly at the edges, but instead with the kuski in the center.
```sh
elma-imager-win.exe -r elmapath/rec/myrec.rec -l elmapath/lev/mylev.lev -o myproject/path/myrec.png -s 10 -e 100 -g transparent
```

## Known Bugs
My cheated pop warmup recs prevent rendering properly.
